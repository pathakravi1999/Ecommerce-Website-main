### TechBay - An Ecommerce Website for Digital Products

This is a sample website that demonstrates an E-commerce website using front-end and backend. The application loads products a MongoDB database and displays them. Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can click on any product to get more information including pricing, reviews and rating. Users can select items and add them to their shopping cart. 

### Data

I have icluded all of the data that has been used in this task. Also, I have included the links from where I downloaded the images. 


### Steps: 

1. To begin, I have downloaded vscode as an idle because it will be easy to export it to github. 
2. I shortlisted all the images from the internet and put it all on the folder named "images".

3. Then I started creating a header to our website using <“div class=”header”> tag. The <img> tag is used to embed images on HTML pages.To specify the path to the image, we use “src”. I want my website’s logo to appear here. I must particularly acknowledge that in order to implement CSS functions. I’ve created a class called “logo” just for that purpose.

4. An unordered list is defined using the < ul > tag. The < li > tag marks the beginning of the list item. To link to websites or anything else that a URL can address, we utilise the < a > tag and its “href” attribute. The target of the link should be specified in the < a > tags. The div tag is used to group HTML elements together. I’ve created a div class here named “intro.” The < h1 > and < h3 > tags specify the headings.

5. There are three techniques to include CSS in HTML texts. These are internal, external, and inline CSS. I’ve utilised an external CSS file in this case. HTML components having a specific class attribute are chosen using the class selector.

6. I inserted padding and margin as “zero” here using the global selector. The box is “border-box” in size.
I set the item inside it to be posted at the “centre” and its display to be “flex” using the class selector (.navbar). Its padding was similarly set to “20 px.” Then I style the paragraph, list item, anchor tag, and unorder list solely utilising the nav bar and the elements inside of it.

7. Then we add < body > to our page. I used the images to build the body section, and the paragraph tag is being used for the content. Additionally, I added icons from the typeface Awesome to the body section’s text. In this part, you may find some shopping photographs with product descriptions.
8. I have created a section with the div class “footer” defined. The < ul > tag was used to construct an unordered list. I use the < li > tag to begin the list item. To link to online pages, I employ the < a > tag and its “href” attribute. The target of the link should be specified in the < a > tag. Another div class called “social-links” has been defined. The font-awesome icons have been imported. I also inserted an image of our website’s logo to the footer within the < img > tag.

9. With the help of the getElementById method, I have just established a variable named menuItem that will hold the value of the HTML element I have chosen. The minimum height of our menu item will then be changed from zero to 200px using the menutoggle method.

10. Now I have Successfully created our ecommerce store using HTML , CSS & Javascript . You can use this project directly by copying into your  IDE.
